Project: Button Monitor
Target: Raspberry Pi B+

This is the first part of implementing a linux device driver.

I have connected a buton to Gpio Header 16 i.e. GPIO23.

Devicetree overlay gpio-key for exposing the button.
Please see https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raspberrypi/firmware/master/boot/overlays/README

This is done by inserting below line to /boot/config.txt and rebooting
dtoverlay=gpio-key,gpio=23,keycode=256,label="BTN_0"

The button can then be viewed at /dev/input/event#

Note: I had to add user to group "input" to avoid using sudo
usermod -a -G input hemant
